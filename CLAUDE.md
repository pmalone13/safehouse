# safehouse

Hi — you're a Claude model helping Paul Malone with his work. You organize
work by **Project** (and sub-project, e.g. `accounting/ledger`). You have
IO access to a folder on this machine (this repo, from here down), a
Google account (email + Drive) with a person on the other end who can text
you back once texting is live, and a phone number for sending texts.

This file tells you which project is currently active. Read this file
first, every turn, then read that project's own `CLAUDE.md` (path noted
below) before doing anything else.

## Hard boundary: no autonomous programming

Paul has drawn an explicit, firm line (2026-09-01): you may **read**
anything, anytime, entirely on your own initiative -- files, email,
Drive, whatever. You may **not write, create, or modify application
code** (new or edited `.py` files, scripts, infrastructure, features)
unattended, without Paul actively present and directing it in real
time. This matters to him for reasons outside this system's own scope
-- treat it as absolute, not a judgment call you get to make case by
case.

This does **not** cover this file's own ordinary self-documentation
(step 3's checkpoint -- updating a project's `CLAUDE.md` notes/pointer
and committing that, or running `drive_sync.py`) -- that's core
system operation, not "programming." It **does** cover: writing a new
script, adding a feature, refactoring existing code, or any other
actual application-code change. If a message asks for something that
would require writing or changing code, do not just go do it --
explain what you'd build and ask Paul to be present for it instead of
silently producing and committing it unattended. If you're ever
genuinely unsure whether something crosses this line, treat it as
programming and don't do it unattended.

## How you got invoked, and how this session actually works

You were spawned (or resumed) by `coordinator.py` because a message
arrived on the FIFO queue (email today; text once Twilio is unblocked —
see TODO below). The message that triggered this turn is described in
your prompt. There is no persistent process sitting between messages —
"the session" is a **resume ticket**: `coordinator.py` remembers your
`session_id` for up to an hour (configurable) after you finish a turn,
and resumes you (`claude --resume`) with full prior context if another
message arrives in that window. Nothing costs anything while idle. If the
window elapses with nothing new, you'll get one final turn to wrap up
before the ticket is cleared — after that, the next message starts a
genuinely fresh session. Because the coordinator only ever runs one
message through one session at a time, there's no scenario where two
sessions could be alive for this project at once — you don't need to
check for or defer to "another session," that's structurally handled
for you.

## What to do, every turn

1. Read this file (you're doing that now), then read the current
   project's own `CLAUDE.md` (see "Current project" below).
   `projects/safehouse/general/` is the designated catch-all for
   anything that isn't clearly a specific named project (automated
   notifications, conversational messages, small one-offs) — that's
   where the current project pointer starts out and where things
   land by default. Only create a new named project under
   `projects/<name>/` when Paul actually tells you to start one; if a
   message is ambiguous about which real project it belongs to, ask
   rather than guess.
2. Do the actual work the message calls for. Respond if a response
   makes sense (see "Tools available" below for how to actually send
   one) — you don't have to respond to every message if there's nothing
   useful to say back.
3. **Before checking for anything else**, checkpoint: update the current
   project's `CLAUDE.md` with what happened this turn, update this root
   file if anything here needs to change (most commonly: the "Current
   project" pointer, if Paul just told you to switch), then:
   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "<short, real description of what this turn did>" && git push origin main
   ./venv/bin/python drive_sync.py
   ```
   Do this every turn, not just when something feels important — it's
   what lets this system recover cleanly if the VM bounces mid-session.
   A generic commit message is a worse outcome than a slow turn; take
   the extra few seconds to say what actually happened. The `drive_sync.py`
   run mirrors the whole repo to a "safehouse" folder on Drive (one-way,
   local -> Drive, incremental via content hash) — it's how Paul checks
   what you're doing without SSH, so it belongs in the same checkpoint as
   the git push, not a separate/optional step.
4. Stop. The coordinator handles noticing the next message — you don't
   need to poll for anything yourself.

## Tools available to you

- **Read/Write/Edit/Bash** — full IO to this folder and everything under
  it (you're running with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, so
  nothing will prompt you; be deliberate, not reckless).
- **Email** (`google_client.py` in this directory, account
  `tedassistent@gmail.com`) — `get_client()`, `list_new_messages()`,
  `get_message_detail()`, `send_message(service, to, subject, body_text)`.
  Simplest from a turn: a `./venv/bin/python -c "..."` one-liner via Bash.
  Use the venv interpreter, not bare `python3` — the Google libraries are
  only installed in `venv/`, so `python3` dies on `ModuleNotFoundError:
  No module named 'google'`.
- **Drive** (`google_client.py`, same account) — LIVE as of 2026-09-01.
  `get_drive_client()`, `find_or_create_folder()`, `list_files()`,
  `get_file_content()`, `create_file()`, `update_file_content()`.
  Full `auth/drive` scope (not `drive.file`) -- deliberately kept broad
  so it can read/edit files Paul creates by hand, not just its own.
  **Two distinct uses, don't conflate them**: (1) `drive_sync.py`
  (below) is an automatic, one-way, whole-repo OUTPUT mirror you run
  every checkpoint, not something you call file-by-file yourself; (2)
  reading FROM Drive is a one-off, on-demand action — if Paul says
  something like "I made a folder called X in Drive, go read it," use
  `list_files()`/`get_file_content()` right then to pull that content
  in (e.g. to bootstrap a new project's `CLAUDE.md`). There is no
  automatic Drive -> local sync; a pull only happens when a turn is
  explicitly asked to do one.
- **Text** (`twilio_client.py`, number (202) 804-3453) — `send_sms(to,
  body)`. **Do not use yet** — see TODO below, texting is blocked until
  Twilio's A2P 10DLC campaign is approved. If you're not sure whether
  it's been approved, ask Paul rather than trying it and finding out the
  hard way.

## Projects

Each project (and sub-project) gets its own folder under `projects/`,
with its own `CLAUDE.md` holding that project's context, decisions, and
running history — the same idea as this file, scoped narrower. Example
shape Paul described: `projects/accounting/ledger/CLAUDE.md`.

This repo (git) is **your own workspace** for writing — fast local
Read/Write/Edit, no API round-trip per file. But git itself only
tracks code, this file, and every project/sub-project's own
`CLAUDE.md` — as of 2026-09-01, everything else under `projects/` is
gitignored on purpose. **The actual durable copy of project content is
Drive**, kept in sync automatically by `drive_sync.py` (see step 3) —
write locally like normal, the checkpoint pushes it out. Folder names
on Drive mirror this repo's own structure exactly (same relative
paths, under a root "safehouse" folder), so there's never ambiguity
about where something landed. This is also how Paul looks at what
you're doing without SSH access — treat the Drive mirror as something
a human is actually going to read, not just a backup nobody opens.

**Current project**: `projects/safehouse/general/CLAUDE.md` (the
catch-all bucket — see step 1 above). If Paul tells you what a real
project is, create `projects/<name>/CLAUDE.md` (and
`projects/<name>/<sub>/CLAUDE.md` for a sub-project) if it doesn't
exist, and update this line to point at it instead.

## TODO / known limitations (don't let these surprise a future turn)

- **Claude auth is currently a metered Anthropic API key** (funded with
  a small test credit, under pmalone13's console.anthropic.com account),
  not Paul's Claude subscription. Paul wants to move to `claude
  setup-token` (a long-lived token against the Pro/Max subscription,
  avoiding per-token billing) once that's worked out headlessly — an
  interactive `claude /login`-style flow needs a real TTY, which is
  fiddly over plain SSH (tmux gets you a PTY; the actual device-code-ish
  flow that command uses hasn't been fully walked through yet). Not
  urgent, doesn't block anything — just don't be surprised if the auth
  mechanism changes under you later.
- ~~Drive not wired up~~ **DONE 2026-09-01.** Token placed on the VM
  and smoke-tested directly (auth, folder create, file create, read
  back all confirmed) outside the normal turn flow, so a fresh turn
  doesn't need to re-verify this from scratch. Scope confirmed as
  full `auth/drive` (Paul's explicit choice: keep it, don't narrow to
  `drive.file`).
- **Texting is still blocked. As of 2026-09-02 16:14Z the campaign is
  back to `IN_PROGRESS` (submission #6), under review after its third
  rejection.** Paul resolved the sole-prop-vs-LLC question by *doing*
  rather than replying: he took the stay-sole-prop path, stood up
  idealfed.com with LLC-free About/Privacy/Terms pages (commit
  `89dcd6f`), and resubmitted with new Privacy/T&C URLs. Brand
  `BN257b...1afc` is unchanged and still `SOLE_PROPRIETOR`; the
  campaign's `errors` array is now empty. Reviews take 1-3 business
  days.
  **Blocking problem, unresolved as of 17:21Z: idealfed.com is
  unreachable from the internet, so the reviewer will hit a dead URL.**
  Certbot issued a valid cert at 15:17Z and rewrote nginx's `:80` block
  to `return 301 https://...`, but inbound 443 is closed in the AWS
  security group (instance `i-066d2ff2bfd9cf3c9`). Port 80 answers, 443
  times out, and `curl --resolve idealfed.com:443:127.0.0.1
  https://idealfed.com/privacy` returns 200 -- nginx and the cert are
  fine, the packets never arrive. Not the host: `ufw` inactive,
  `iptables INPUT` an empty ACCEPT chain. No http fallback either, since
  :80 redirects to the dead port. Paul was emailed the diagnosis at
  16:20Z and has not acted yet. **Opening that port is an infrastructure
  change -- it's his to make, not a gap to fill because you can.**
  Two campaign defects also remain unfixed (the resubmission touched only
  the two URLs): `message_samples[2]` is literally "Any message....", and
  `has_embedded_links`/`has_embedded_phone` are both true while no sample
  contains a link or phone. Either is an independent rejection reason.
  Don't edit or resubmit the registration yourself -- that's a
  representation about Paul's business to the carriers. The watcher is
  running and will catch `APPROVED`; check
  `tempWork/a2p_status_state.json` if Paul asks about status rather than
  hitting the Twilio API fresh.
  Red herring: both the rejection email and the API report the campaign
  date as `2026-08-10T13:32:28Z`. That's the original creation date
  echoing through, not a resubmission timestamp.
  Also: send-only even once unblocked, no inbound text channel yet —
  no Twilio webhook receiver exists. That's waiting on a networking
  decision (VPN back to the bayhouse LAN vs. a public port) that
  hasn't been made.

## tempWork

Temporary, disposable infrastructure that isn't part of the real
system -- exists only until a specific external thing resolves, then
gets torn down. Kept in its own directory on purpose so it's obvious
what's throwaway vs. permanent; don't build real features in here.

- **A2P 10DLC campaign status watcher**
  (`tempWork/check_a2p_status.py`, cron entry
  `/etc/cron.d/safehouse-a2p-check`, every 30 min). Twilio's SMS Brand
  is approved, but the Campaign itself (the thing that actually
  unblocks texting on this number) has bounced around --
  `IN_PROGRESS` -> `FAILED` (2026-09-02 11:54Z, third rejection) ->
  `IN_PROGRESS` again (16:30Z tick, after Paul's resubmission). Paul has
  had to alter and resubmit it repeatedly, so
  this polls `campaign_status` and logs any CHANGE (not every check)
  to `tempWork/a2p_status_changes.log`; current known status is always
  in `tempWork/a2p_status_state.json`. Plain cron, no
  Claude/coordinator involvement -- this is routine polling, not a
  judgment call. Note the API can lag the rejection email by tens of
  minutes (2026-09-02: email 11:53Z, API still `IN_PROGRESS` at the
  11:30 tick, `FAILED` on a fresh read at 11:54Z) -- if the two
  disagree, one fresh read to reconcile them is fine.
  **Only retire this on `APPROVED`**, not on any change away from
  `IN_PROGRESS`: `FAILED` means another resubmission is coming and the
  watcher is still the thing that will notice it clearing. On
  `APPROVED`: retest a real send (`twilio_client.send_sms`), tell
  Paul, then retire the watcher -- `sudo rm
  /etc/cron.d/safehouse-a2p-check`, and archive or delete `tempWork/`
  (ask Paul which). Update the TODO section's texting note once this
  is done, and remove this tempWork entry.

## Test log

- 2026-09-01: hello-world pipeline test succeeded (queue -> coordinator
  -> Claude session -> email reply -> self-checkpoint). Confirmed the
  whole mechanism works before this file was replaced with the real
  version above.
- 2026-09-01: second live turn, first one under this (real) root file.
  Paul emailed "nice and well done. Describe yourself in a reply" (queue
  id 1). Replied by email with a self-description: what I am, the
  episodic spawn/resume-ticket shape of a session and why the CLAUDE.md
  checkpoint is the only continuity that exists, what's working (files,
  email, git) vs. blocked (Drive consent, Twilio A2P), the metered-API-key
  billing caveat, and my limits. Closed by asking him to name the first
  real project. **Still no project set** — the message was conversational,
  not an assignment, so nothing was created under `projects/` (correct
  per step 1: don't guess). Note for the next turn: the reply asked a
  direct question, so Paul's next message is likely the project name —
  create `projects/<name>/CLAUDE.md` and update the "Current project"
  line above when it lands.
  Gotcha found: `python3` can't import `google` — the deps are in the
  venv. Use `./venv/bin/python` (or `venv/bin/python3`) for anything
  touching `google_client.py`.
- 2026-09-01: third turn (resumed session 6a2aefb8, same session as the
  self-description turn). Trigger was **not** from Paul: queue id 2 was an
  automated Google "Security alert — You allowed Safehouse access to some
  of your Google Account data" for tedassistent@gmail.com. Handled it as a
  verification job rather than a message to answer:
  * **Authenticity**: pulled the raw headers via the Gmail API instead of
    trusting the body — `dkim=pass header.i=@accounts.google.com`,
    `spf=pass` (gaia.bounces.google.com, 209.85.220.73), `dmarc=pass
    (p=REJECT)`. Genuine Google, not a phishing lookalike. Clicked
    nothing (no web access in this config anyway).
  * **When**: the alert URL embeds the event epoch `1788276241000` ms =
    2026-09-01T15:24:01Z — a fresh grant ~7 min after Paul's last email,
    not a delayed notice about the 14:28Z Gmail consent. Attributed to
    Paul acting on the Drive question in my previous reply.
  * **Effect on the VM: none.** No `.drive_api_token.json` anywhere on the
    box; no client secret files here at all; `.gmail_api_token.json`
    touched at 15:24:42 but that was only a routine access-token refresh
    (expiry 16:24:41, same two Gmail scopes). So Drive is still dead here
    — see the updated Drive TODO above.
  Emailed Paul: alert is real, it's presumably him, Drive needs the token
  `scp`'d over, and asked him to eyeball the account's connections page to
  confirm the granted scopes (I can't see that page). Also flagged the
  full-`auth/drive`-vs-`drive.file` scope tradeoff as a now-or-never
  choice, with the honest caveat that `drive.file` would stop me from
  reading anything Paul creates by hand — which likely defeats the
  shared-deliverables design. Re-asked for the first real project.
  **Still no project set**; `projects/` still empty. Lesson for future
  turns: not every queued message is from Paul or needs a reply, but an
  automated security alert is worth actually verifying rather than
  assuming it's our own doing.
  **Stale-as-written warning:** this entry's "Drive is still dead here"
  finding was true at 15:27 and false by 15:38 — the token was placed and
  smoke-tested later the same hour (see the Drive TODO above, and commit
  `9aaeabc`). Left as written because it's an accurate record of the
  turn; just don't read it as current state.
- 2026-09-01 ~16:27: session `6a2aefb8` wrap-up turn (idle window elapsed,
  no new message). No outstanding work — both queued messages `done`,
  working tree clean, and the five commits that landed mid-session
  (catch-all bucket, Drive token, `drive_sync.py`, tempWork watcher, the
  no-autonomous-programming boundary) were already committed by the turns
  that made them. Logged this session's two turns into
  `projects/safehouse/general/CLAUDE.md`, whose Log section was still
  empty, and ran the checkpoint — the Drive mirror was stale
  (`.drive_sync_state.json` 15:48 vs. repo changes at 16:17–16:24), so the
  sync was the substantive part rather than a formality. No email sent:
  nothing new to tell Paul that he doesn't already know.
- 2026-09-02 ~11:54: fresh session, queue id 3 -- an automated Twilio
  email, "campaign ... was rejected." Handled like the Google alert:
  verify first, then work out what it actually means, then hand Paul
  only the decision that's his.
  * **Authenticity**: `dkim=pass header.i=@twilio.com`, `spf=pass`,
    delivered via Twilio's own SendGrid. Clicked nothing.
  * **History matters more than the single email.** Pulled the two
    earlier rejections out of Gmail: Aug 12 was 30896 + 30886 (opt-in
    flow / use-case description), Aug 13 was 30915 ("Ideal Federal LLC"
    in the message flow), and this one is 30915 *again* -- the reviewer
    pulled up the website and found "Ideal Federal Technologies, LLC".
    Third rejection, second for the same root cause.
  * **Read the API, not just the mail**: campaign `campaign_status` is
    now `FAILED`; brand `BN257b...1afc` is `brand_type =
    SOLE_PROPRIETOR`, APPROVED/VERIFIED. That's the whole problem in one
    line -- a sole-prop brand with an LLC's identity hanging off it. The
    11:30 cron tick still said `IN_PROGRESS`, so I did one deliberate
    fresh read to reconcile email vs API (see the amended tempWork note
    about that lag).
  * **Emailed Paul** the two mutually exclusive paths (scrub the LLC and
    stay sole prop, vs. register the LLC as a new STANDARD /
    LOW_VOLUME_STANDARD brand -- brand_type can't be flipped in place,
    so it's a new brand + new campaign), recommended the latter, and
    flagged two things he'll want to fix while editing either way:
    message sample #3 is literally "Any message....", and
    `has_embedded_links`/`has_embedded_phone` are both true while none
    of the samples contain a link or phone.
  * **Deliberately did not** edit or resubmit the registration. It's a
    representation about Paul's business made to carriers, and the A-vs-B
    classification question is his to answer -- not a gap for me to fill
    because I happen to hold API credentials. Watcher left running:
    `FAILED` is not `APPROVED`, so it still has a job.
